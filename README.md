## Please note that I tested the script on Windows only.
## selenium==3.141.0

## Installation
Set up a Python virtualenv, activate it, and run `pip install -r
requirements.txt`, then you can just run `python saucedemo.py`

## How To Use It

* Make sure that you have Google Chrome installed and that it is up to date
* Also install the chromedriver for Selenium. See [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads). 

## How To Install Python

### Windows
See [this link](https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/), but I make no guarantees that Selenium will actually work as I have not tested it.
